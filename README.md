## Dev rules

### Typo

Java typo, fields without `m` prefix.

### Commit message

In order to have a clean commit list and to easily find feature of a commit (goal, fix bug...), the commit message should respect some rules.
Commit messages are important. They are the only way to give context to the changes that are made in a commit.

* Mandatory rules: `[Player] Improve the player X control` where the `[` and `]` surround the feature.
* Optional rules emoji: `[Player] :fire: Fix the player X control` where emoji could be the one you want or one of this one:
    * :fire: `:fire:` Fix a bug.
    * :wrench: `:wrench:` Feature dev that is not ui.
    * :art: `:art:` UI commit, readme, all that is visible.
    * :recycle: `:recycle:` Clean, reformat, refactor, ortho, typo...
    * :seedling: `:seedling:` New feature, first commit.
    * :skeleton: `:skeleton:` Architecture/skeleton of a feature.
* Optional: Write the `Why`, the `Reason` of your commit in the message description.

Do our future selves a favour and start writing better commit messages now :)
